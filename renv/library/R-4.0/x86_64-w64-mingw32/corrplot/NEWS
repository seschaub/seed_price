  * RColorBrewer is now a suggested package (not required)

NEW FEATURES
  * Fixed #99 : A new option insig = "label_sig" to mark significant correlations.

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.82
BUG FIXES
  * Fixed #10: corrplot with type = "upper" and long colname strings cuts off top labels
  * Fixed #19: Color Legend has 0 width when only 1 column is used
  * Fixed #70: NA errors when is.corr = F
  * Fixed #77: Error when the matrix(corr) contains NA values.

NEW FEATURES
  * Fixed #18: title position and pie corrplot background circle
    * Used existing parameter `outline` to control the border color of pie symbols.
  * Fixed #66: `lim.segment` parameter default value
    * added default value "auto" for `lim.segment` parameter
  * Fixed #76: corrplot.mixed with black color correlation coefficient
    * Added two new parameters `lower.col` and `upper.col`
  * Fixed #79: Changing aspect ratio for the plot
    * Added a new parameter `win.asp` which controls the aspect ratio of the plotted matrix.
  * Added more examples to the vignette

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.81

CHANGES
  * Fixed #79: added parameter `win.asp` to control aspect ratio
  * Fixed #18: parameter `outline` combined with `method="pie"` controls
    the color of the otline circle of each pie.
  * updated vignette

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.80

CHANGES
  * Fixed #70: Enable to plot a matrix with NA when 'is.corr = F'

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.77

CHANGES
  * Fixed #58: make sure the margin is correct in corrplot.mixed().
  * Revised document.

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.76

CHANGES
  * In corrplot(), added parameters na.label and na.label.col that define how NA values inside a matrix should be rendered.
  * In corrplot(), na.label can now use one or two characters, default is "?" (issue #55)
  * Fixed #17: restore par() settings on exit  (thanks, #yihui)
  * Fixed #16: checks for [-1, 1] interval are too strict.
  * Fixed #15: error with correlation plot using insig argument when all values are significant.
  * Fixed #9: added ward.D and ward.D2 hclust methods (thanks, #jeffzemla)

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.70

CHANGES
  *  In corrplot(), parameter insig add a  option "p-value", now p-values can be conveniently added on the glyph.
  *  Return value changes, corrplot() now returns a reordered correlation matrix.

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.66

CHANGES
  *  Add html vignette, which was generated from markdown file by knitr.
  *  In corrplot(), remove parameter "zoom", add "is.corr"; now it is more convenient to
     visualize  non-correlation matrix. Parameter "addtextlabel" was renamed as "tl.pos",
     and "addcolorlabel" was renamed as "cl.pos".

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.60

NEW FEATURES
  *  Now corrplot() can deal with the matrix not in [-1,1] by parameter "zoom" now.
     Warning: please make sure the visualization you take after data zoom is meaningful!

CHANGES
  *  Function corr.rect() was renamed as corrRect().
  *  Revise document. (THANKS, Tao Gao)
  *  In function corrplot(), "order"'s choice "PCA" was precisely renamed as "AOE".
	 and "FPC" was added for the first principal component order.
  *  Add function corrMatOrder(), and corrplot.mixed().
  *  Remove seldom used functions: corrplot.circle(), corrplot.ellipse(),
     corrplot.square(), corrplot.shade(), corrplot.color(), corrplot.number().
  *  In corrplot(), remove parameter "assign.col" and "cl.range",
     add "zoom", "cl.lim" and "addCoefasPercent".

		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.54

CHANGES
  *  Parameter "tl.cex" in function corrplot() is more sensitive.

BUG FIXES
  *  The issue that too much space adding to the margins (especially using a longer text label
     or a larger font size) has been fixed.
  *  Specifying wrong color to the glyphs has been fixed.
