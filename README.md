## R-Code: The costs of diversity: higher prices for more diverse grassland seed mixtures
<br>

We provide here the R-code for reproducing Schaub et al (2021a). 
<br>
<br>
 
The code is structured into <br> 
- *'seed_price_master.R'*: the master R script <br>
- *'seed_price_des_analysis.R'*: runs the descriptive analysis, including the Upset approach <br>
- *'seed_price_lin_model.R'*: runs the linear analysis of the relationship between seed prices and plant diversity <br>
<br>
<br>

In order to run the analysis you need to <br>
1) create a project folder and within this main folder you need to create a sub-folder called *'r_code'*, in which you save all provided r scripts.  <br>
2) specify your main working directory (i.e., *'wd_code'*) in the R script *'seed_price_master.R'*.<br>
3) Now you can run the R script *'seed_price_master.R'*, which downloads the data automatically and reproduces our analysis.
